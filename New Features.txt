Feature Ideas:
Give users a nice "database view" or book view to see highlights based on selection
Let users control which books they want to receive random highlights from
Should you focus on 5-10 highlights from a single book each day ? or entirely random?

Create a web app using streamlit to see that day's quote
Give users the ability to put in their email address to get those quotes?

Database view
Quotes of the day view
What other views in app? Settings view?, book selection view
# of quotes to receive per day view
mechanism for receiving quotes - either email or text message

Mechanism for deleting quotes that are over e.g. 70% similar - due to Kindle glitch! OR -
that match word for word up to a given point with another quote in the database

Original Notes
Export the HTML file of notes/highlights using the Kindle app > send to an email that you will be able to parse
Want to store all highlights in a SQL database along w/ metadata from book that you can fetch from Google Books API (especially title, book cover image, etc)
Generate daily email or SMS w/ 5-10 quotes from a book you have read to review > make it clean with a picture of the title cover
Provide a clean front end for viewing the SQL database of highlights web app

How to get the data out regularly?
myclippings.txt file from kindle via USB connection
export summary from Kindle App after every book

Connect Kindle via usb, drag & drop myclippings.txt - does myclippings.txt work between devices?

Good verbiage > add to app
It's one thing to read a book, but it's another thing to actually get something out of that book. Active reading is key here along with regular review
Reading process = Read & highlight + take notes in the margin
Might need to figure out how to add notes into this app

Take the highlights & notes and then turn into Anki decks to regularly review
How to implement Anki review algorithm into this app?

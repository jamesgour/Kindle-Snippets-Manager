Feature Ideas:
Give users a nice "database view" or book view to see highlights based on selection
Let users control which books they want to receive random highlights from
Should you focus on 5-10 highlights from a single book each day ? or entirely random?

Create a web app using streamlit to see that day's quote
Give users the ability to put in their email address to get those quotes?

Database view
Quotes of the day view
What other views in app? Settings view?, book selection view
# of quotes to receive per day view
mechanism for receiving quotes - either email or text message
